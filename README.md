# Kruskal's algorithm
Python 3 implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimal spanning tree in an undirected weighted connected graph

* Input : 
  graph : a tuple containing : 
    - a list of vertices
    - a list of edges written as edge = ("vertex1", "vertex2", w) where w is a number
    
* Output : 
  a tuple contaning:
    - a list of all the edges included in the minimal spanning tree
    - the total weight of all these edges
