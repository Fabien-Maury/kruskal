# Kruskal's algorithm
Python 3 implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimal spanning tree in an undirected weighted connected graph

# Input :

  A tuple containing : 
      * a list of vertices
      * a list of edges written as edge = ("vertex1", "vertex2", w) where w is a number
    
# Output :

A tuple containing :
    * a list of all the edges included in the minimal spanning tree
    * the total weight of all these edges
